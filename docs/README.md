# Energy Systems

This website is all about making energy systems easy to understand. We'll explore how power systems work, managing energy, keeping the grid stable, and charging electric vehicles. You'll get to learn about these topics and more, which all come together to make up our energy system.

The content should be helpful for software engineers, software architects and technical project managers in the energy and utilities industry. As a computer scientist working in the energy domain, understanding the main parts of power systems and TSOs was my motivation to start this project :)

Each buidling block has its name, description and the possible sub components, services and features. A visual diagram is used when needed to simplify complex concepts. Links to online resources and GitHub repositories are added when available.
