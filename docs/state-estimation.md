# State Estimation

## What?
 State Estimation is a computational process used in power systems to determine the most accurate possible picture of the electrical grid's current state.
 This involves estimating various state variables, like voltages and power flows, across different nodes and lines in the grid.       

## How?
- **Data Collection:** It starts by collecting data from sensors spread across the grid, like voltage and current measurements.",
- **Grid Modeling:** The power grid is represented by a mathematical model, typically nonlinear equations based on physical laws like Kirchhoffâ€™s laws.
- **Statistical Analysis** in State Estimation involves feeding noisy and incomplete data into a statistical process, using techniques like Least Squares Estimation to reconcile these measurements with the grid model by minimizing differences between them. For nonlinear models, an iterative refinement process is often necessary to fine-tune the estimation, ensuring the results accurately reflect the grid's current state.
- **Error Analysis:** The process includes evaluating the reliability of the estimated state, considering the quality and quantity of the input data.          
       
## Why?
 - **Data Incompleteness:** In a vast power grid, it's impractical to measure every variable directly due to logistical and technological limitations.
 - **Measurement Errors:** The measurements that are available often come with noise and errors, as sensors and data acquisition systems are not perfect.
- **Grid Reliability and Efficiency:** Accurate state estimation is crucial for the reliable and efficient operation of the power grid. It helps in real-time monitoring, decision-making for load management, and preventing potential failures.
